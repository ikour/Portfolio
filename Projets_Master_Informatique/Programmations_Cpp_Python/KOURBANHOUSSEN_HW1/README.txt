Exercise 1: It’s (almost) Christmas time!

    This program will draw a Christmas tree with the characters ‘*’ and ‘|’.

    Example of command to compile : g++ -o Christmas ex1.cpp
    Example of command to run : ./Christmas
            Then give a number for the height of the tree 


Exercise 2: Quiz!

    This program will answer some questions about the first lecture.

    Example of command to compile : g++ -o quiz_wrong ex2.cpp
    Example of command to run : ./quiz_wrong
            Then give the numbers of the questions you want to ask.
            But you can only ask 5 questions.


Exercise 3: Vector multiplication

    This program will do a pointwise multiplication between two vectors entered on the input stream.

    Example of command to compile : g++ -o vector ex3.cpp
    Example of command to run : ./vector
            Then give the size of one vector, followed by 2n integers.
            The first n integers are the value of the first vector, the following n integers are the value of the second. 
            Each of the 2n + 1 can be separated by a space or a new line.
